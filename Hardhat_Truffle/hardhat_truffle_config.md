# React Project Setup Using Hardhat & Truffle - part 2

Now that we have our project set up, we will have to do some configurations before we start writing our contract

## Configuration Setup

---

Each project should now have a configuation file in the root directory
for Truffle it should be named ```truffle-config.js```

For Hardhat it should be named ```hardhat.config.js```

Let's configure our complier version for Solidity as well as the network we will be deploying our contract to
