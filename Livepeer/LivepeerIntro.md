What is Livepeer? If you search online, the result will be different and that is because Livepeer wears many hats. This article is to give a brief summary of the different hats Livepeer wears, in later articles, we will go deeper for each one.

## Livepeer Inc. - The company

Livepeer is a company that was founded in 2017 by [Doug Petkanics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougpetkanics/) and [Eric Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericxtang/). The company is based out of New York and focuses on video technology and services. It is comprised of two entites. [Livepeer.com](https://livepeer.com/) and [Livepeer.org](https://livepeer.org/)

## Livepeer.com - The Video Streaming Service

This part of Livepeer provides video infrastructure for its users by having ease of use, addressing scalable solutions, reliabilbity as well as allowing different use cases. Users have the ability to stream or broadcast videos for difference use cases such as [creator streaming](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/creator-platforms), [gamer streaming](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/game-streaming-platforms), and  [ecommerce](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/ecommerce) to name a few. 

Livepeer.com takes the user's video data and is able to transcode it for them, which allows the videos created to be playable in the most optimal of format that the end user has, whether it be desktop, mobile or other kinds of devices.

Users can expect to be able to stream multiple ways using [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol), and devlopers can experiment with a [demo app](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/application-development/example-app) from Livepeer or start building their own app.

## Livepeer.org - The Decentralized Streaming Network

This is the other side of Livepeer, which is a decentralized video streaming network. Because Livepeer.com works with Livepeer.org, this is the reason why Livepeer.com is able to offer their users cheaper transcoding rates and well as easier scaling solutions.

The Livepeer network runs on ther [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) blockcahin, which means that is decentralized and more secure due to the nature of [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain).

Livepeer has a quick primer about how it works [Here](https://livepeer.org/primer).

There is also a site called [LivePeer Academy](https://livepeer.academy/) built by their community that has resources additional to the Livepeer websites.
