Livepeer is a company that was founded in 2017 by [Doug Petkanics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougpetkanics/) and [Eric Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericxtang/). The company is based out of New York and focuses on video technology and services. It is comprised of two entities, [Livepeer.com](https://livepeer.com/) and [Livepeer.org](https://livepeer.org/)

## Livepeer.com - The Video Streaming Service

This part of Livepeer is a Saas that provides video infrastructure for its users by having ease of use, addressing scalable solutions, reliability as well as allowing different use cases. Users have the ability to stream or broadcast videos for difference use cases such as [creator streaming](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/creator-platforms), [game streaming](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/game-streaming-platforms), and  [ecommerce](https://livepeer.com/use-cases/ecommerce) to name a few. 

Livepeer.com takes the user's video data and is able to transcode it for them, which allows the videos created to be playable in the most optimal of format that the end user has, whether it be desktop, mobile or other kinds of devices.

Users can expect to be able to stream multiple ways using [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol), and developers can experiment with a [demo app](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/application-development/example-app) from Livepeer or start building their own app.

## Livepeer.org - The Decentralized Streaming Network

The other side of Livepeer, which is a decentralized video streaming network is called Livepeer.org (also known as protocal in the Web3 world). Because Livepeer.com works with Livepeer.org, this is the reason why Livepeer.com is able to offer their users cheaper transcoding rates as well as easier scaling solutions.

The Livepeer network runs on their [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) blockchain, which means that is decentralized and more secure due to the nature of [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). By utilizing this technology, it provides Livepeer the ability to create resources for video streamers and broadcasters that centralized solutions are not able to offer due to the nature of traditional structures.
