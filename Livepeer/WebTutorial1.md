# How to stream live with Livepeer

In this article, we will go through all the steps to build a simple website using html that will playback our live stream using Livepeer.

## Workflow for live streaming

When creating a live stream ther are some equipments involved for the streamer. A streams needs to have a video source for capturing the visuals, an audio source to capture the sounds, if any that goes with the video. After that is established, the raw data from both sources needs to be converted so that it can be trasmitted over the internet. Afterwards, this data then needs to be converted to the ideal formats regardless of what the device is for viewing. This is what the transcode does. Finally, a player of some sort is used to play back the final version of the data and is what the view will see.

Below are simplified steps to create a simple live stream:

- [ ] Video source -  we will use the computer's built-in web camera.
